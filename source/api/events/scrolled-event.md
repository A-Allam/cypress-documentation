title: scrolled

The `scrolled` event fires whenever **Cypress** is scrolling your application. This event is fired when Cypress is {% url 'waiting for and calculating actionability' interacting-with-elements %}. It will scroll to 'uncover' elements currently being covered. This event is extremely useful to debug why Cypress may think an element is not interactive.

# Environment

Some events run in the {% url "browser" all-events#Browser-Events %}, some in the {% url "background process" background-process %}, and some in both.

Event | Browser | Background Process
--- | --- | ---
`scrolled` | {% fa fa-check-circle green %} | {% fa fa-times-circle grey %}

# Arguments

**{% fa fa-angle-right %} el** ***(Object)***

The element or `window` being scrolled

**{% fa fa-angle-right %} type** ***('element'|'window'|'container')***

# Usage

In a spec file or support file you can tap into the `scrolled` event.

Cypress.on('scrolled', (elOrWindow, type) => {
