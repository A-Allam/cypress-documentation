# 3.1.5

*Released 12/25/2018*

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed issue where the `onLoad` event was never being called when calling `cy.visit()` on the url Cypress is currently navigated to. {% issue 1311 %}
- Fixed regression introduced in `3.1.4` that caused an `InvalidStateError` when visiting a page with an XHR request with a `responseType` other than `text` or `''`. Fixes {% issue 3008 %}
- Fixed issue where Cypress would reroute to a 404 page when calling {% url "`cy.visit()`" visit %} in Chromium version 72.0.3605.0 by adding `--proxy-bypass-list=<-loopback>` command line argument to Chrome. Fixes {% issue 1872 %} and {% issue 3252 %}
- Fixed issue where Cypress would route to defined `baseUrl` instead of defined route passed to {% url "`cy.visit()`" visit %} in Chromium version 72.0.3605.0. Fixes {% issue 1777 %}
- We now pass the `timeout` option of {% url "`cy.request()`" request %} to the `request` library behind the scenes. This should fix some instances where large `timeout` values would cause `ESOCKETTIMEDOUT` errors. Fixes {% issue 2669 %}
- Fixed issue where Cypress would inject a script tag before the `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration when the document only contained the doctype declaration. Fixes {% issue 2617 %}
- The error message when visiting a site with an invalid content-type now prints the correct content-type of the response Cypress received from the web server. Fixes {% issue 3101 %}
- Fixed issue where `layout.html` would always be loaded in the Test Runner instead of the spec file selected in Cypress. Fixes {% issue 2891 %}
- Fixed issue where the Chromium browser was not detected in Linux due to Cypress not distinguishing between Chrome and Chromium browsers with the same version. Fixes {% issue 1400 %}
- Fixed issue of Cypress being unable to play videos with `autoplay`. We now pass the `--no-user-gesture-required` command line switch to Chrome. Fixes {% issue 2376 %}
- We now pass the Chromium command line switches `--use-fake-ui-for-media-stream` and `--use-fake-device-for-media-stream` to Chrome by default in order to better support testing webcam functionality. Fixes {% issue 2704 %}
- Updated filenames allowed for screenshots to allow more characters that are valid. Fixes {% issue 3052 %}
- Fix issue where error would throw when calling {% url "`cy.visit()`" visit %} to an application with a legacy common.js jQuery version.
- Fixed TypeScript error caused by `dtslint` dependency introduced in 3.1.4. Fixes {% issue 3024 %} and {% issue 3136 %}
- Improved error message displayed for `cypress cache` to not display `[object Object]` and made `--help` labels more descriptive. Fixes {% issue 2589 %}

**Misc:**

- Improved errors shown when opening a project in the Desktop Application. The design is more readable and the error's stack trace is now expandable. Addresses {% issue 2955 %}
- Improved experience of search in Desktop Application when there are no results. Addresses {% issue 3146 %}
- Updated tooltip content so that it no longer flows outside of the tooltip in the Test Runner when displaying longer routes. Fixes {% issue 2980 %}
- Added word labels beside icons in Desktop Application for 'Support' and 'Docs' links. Addresses {% issue 3091 %}

- Fixed incorrect JSDoc comments in type definition for {% url ".focus()" focus %} and better formatted comments in type definitions. Addresses {% issue 2975 %} and {% issue 2954 %}
