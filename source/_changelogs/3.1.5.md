# 3.1.5

*Released 12/25/2018*

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed issue where the `onLoad` event was never being called when calling `cy.visit()` on the url Cypress is currently navigated to. {% issue 1311 %}
- Fixed regression introduced in `3.1.4` that caused an `InvalidStateError` when visiting a page with an XHR request with a `responseType` other than `text` or `''`. Fixes {% issue 3008 %}
- Fixed issue where Cypress would reroute to a 404 page when calling {% url "`cy.visit()`" visit %} in Chromium version 72.0.3605.0. Fixes {% issue 1872 %}
- We now pass the `timeout` option of {% url "`cy.request()`" request %} to the `request` library behind the scenes. This should fix some instances where large `timeout` values would cause `ESOCKETTIMEDOUT` errors. Fixes {% issue 2669 %}
- Fixed issue where Cypress would inject a script tag before the `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration when the document only contained the doctype declaration. Fixes {% issue 2617 %}
- The error message when visiting a site with an invalid content-type now prints the correct content-type of the response Cypress received from the web server. Fixes {% issue 3101 %}
- Fixed issue of Cypress being unable to play videos with `autoplay`. We now pass the `--no-user-gesture-required` command line switch to Chrome. Fixes {% issue 2376 %}
- We now pass the Chromium command line switches `--use-fake-ui-for-media-stream` and `--use-fake-device-for-media-stream` to Chrome by default in order to better support testing webcam functionality. Fixes {% issue 2704 %}
- Updated filenames allowed for screenshots to allow more characters that are valid. Fixes {% issue 3052 %}
- Fix issue where error would throw when calling {% url "`cy.visit()`" visit %} to an application with a legacy common.js jQuery version.
- Fixed TypeScript error caused by `dtslint` dependency introduced in 3.1.4. Fixes {% issue 3024 %} and {% issue 3136 %}
