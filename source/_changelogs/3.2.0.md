# 3.2.0

*Released 3/13/2019*

**Features:**

- {% url "`cy.visit()`" visit %} has been expanded to allow options `url`, `method`, `body`, and `headers`. This allows {% url "`cy.visit()`" visit %} to be called with a `POST` method or with headers like `Accept-Language` or `Authorization`. Fixes {% issue 1500 %}, {% issue 1904 %} and {% issue 908 %}.
- The {% url "`--browser` argument" command-line#cypress-run-browser-lt-browser-name-or-path-gt %} of the {% url "Command Line" command-line %} and the {% url "`browser` argument" module-api#cypress-run %} of the {% url "Module API" module-api %} have been updated to allow passing a `<path>`. Addresses {% issue 1026 %}.
- {% url "`cy.type()`" type %} now accepts `{home}` and `{end}` special character sequences to move the cursor to the start or end of a line. Addresses {% issue 2033 %}.

**Bugfixes:**

- Problems logging in through GitHub in the Test Runner have been fixed. The GitHub login window no longer shows the browser support banner and the "Authorize cypress-io" button is no longer disabled. Fixes {% issue 1251 %}.
- Cypress now detects more instances of `browser` installations. Fixes {% issue 3183 %} and {% issue 3218 %}.
- Fixed issue with loading fixture files containing more than one `.` in their filename while not specifying the file extension. We are also displaying a clearer warning when a fixture file cannot be found. Fixes {% issue 1402 %}.
- All third party `@types` have been moved from Cypress `dependencies` into `devDependencies`. This should fix situations where user's type dependencies were conflicting with Cypress's third party type definitions. Fixes {% issue 3371 %} and {% issue 1227 %}.
- `Cypress.config('baseUrl')` has been updated to no longer strip singular `/` at the end of urls and instead only strip instances of multiple `/`. Fixes {% issue 3540 %}.
- The prompt to "Restore pages?" is no longer displayed within Chrome upon restarting a crashed Chrome window. Addresses {% issue 2048 %}.
- {% url "`cy.wrap()`" wrap %} no longer throws an error when a non-jQuery wrapped DOM element is passed in as an argument. Fixes {% issue 3549 %}.
- Fixed issue where all arguments passed to `setTimeout` or `setInterval` were not properly passed on to the target function. Fixes {% issue 3592 %}.
- {% url "`.filter()` filter %} has been updated so that when called with a function, the options are now properly read. Fixes {% issue 3315 %}.
- Cypress's recognition of websites attempting framebusting has been updated to include framebusting code wrapped within `()`. {% issue 3267 %}

**Misc:**

- The number of logs printed when installing Cypress in docker has been reduced. Partially addresses {% issue 1243 %}.
- The seeded Kitchen Sink examples have some new examples showing how to add a message to assertions, how to compare the text content of two elements, and how to make assertions about `data` attributes. The examples also have some small typo fixes. Fixes {% issue 502 %}. Addressed in {% PR 3272 %}, {% PR 3287 %}, and {% PR 3700 %}.
- The instructions in Cypress's update window now include `yarn` update instructions alongside `npm`. Addresses {% issue 2871 %}.
- The spec file's font weight has been increased within the Test Runner for better readability. Addressed in {% issue 3065 %}.
- We improved the error message displayed when a record key is unrecognized during `cypress run`. Addresses {% issue 1449 %}.
- We improved the typings when using `Cypress.on` to listen for `window.alert` events to allow for `Sinon.stub`. Fixes {% issue 3451 %}.
- Fixed typo in typing for {% url "`.trigger`" trigger %} options. Addressed in {% PR 3588 %}.
