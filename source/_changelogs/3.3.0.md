# 3.3.0

*Released 4/19/2019*

**Features:**

- Cypress now automatically reads from your system's `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY` environment variables and proxies traffic accordingly through Cypress based on these values. This includes network traffic within your application under test, when downloading Cypress, and when accessing 'Runs' within the Test Runner. Please read our new {% url "Proxy Configuration" proxy-configuration %} doc to understand more about proxy configuration in Cypress. Fixes {% issue 672 %}, {% issue 733 %}, {% issue 939 %}, {% issue 1039 %}, {% issue 1459 %}, {% issue 1469 %}, {% issue 1470 %}, {% issue 1541 %}, {% issue 1608 %}, {% issue 2295 %}, {% issue 3855 %}, {% issue 3865 %}, {% issue 1401 %} and {% issue 3857 %}.
- Your project's current proxy settings now display in the {% url "Settings of the Test Runner" proxy-configuration#View-proxy-settings-in-Cypress %}. Addresses {% issue 3856 %}.
- We now offer a separate 32bit and 64bit build for Windows. Addresses {% issue 716 %}, {% issue 787 %}, {% issue 2095 %}, {% issue 706 %}.
- {% url "`.type()`" type %} now supports the special character sequences `{insert}`, `{pageup}`, and `{pagedown}`. Addresses {% issue 3845 %}.
- We now indicate which XHRs match which alias in the Command Log on {% url "`.wait()`" wait %} when they match an alias multiple times. Addresses {% issue 477 %}.
- The console log when clicking on the {% url "`cy.visit()`" visit %} command now displays its resolved `options` arguments. Addresses {% issue 3721 %}.
- There's a new 'canceled' XHR status shown on the Command Log to indicate the difference between calling `xhr.abort()` and the browser canceling the request due to page navigation. Addresses {% issue 3973 %}.
- The Electron browser now runs Chrome Version 61. Addresses {% issue 4000 %}.
- Running Cypress via `cypress run` now supports scripts of `type="module"`. Fixes {% issue 3696 %}.

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed a regression introduced in {% url "3.2.0" changelog#3-2-0 %} that caused an error to throw when visiting domains with certain public suffixes. Fixes {% issue 3717 %}.
- When running Cypress with `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variables set, Cypress no longer issues an incorrect 0 exit code. {% issue 1676 %}
- Fixed a regression introduced in {% url "3.2.0" changelog#3-2-0 %} that caused {% url "`.its()`" its %} to no longer retry when it yields `undefined`. {% issue 3837 %}
- Fixed a regression introduced in {% url "3.2.0" changelog#3-2-0 %} that caused {% url "`cy.fixture()`" fixture %} to throw a `EISDIR` error if a directory had the same name as a file within that same directory. Fixes {% issue 3739 %}.
- We changed Cypress's implementation to no longer rely on internal XHR events when the browser navigates. This fixes a a bug in Chrome 71+ that could cause XHRs to pend forever. Fixes {% issue 3973 %}.
- We greatly improved the speed of proxied requests through our network layer. Fixes {% issue 3192 %} and {% issue 1469 %}.
- Cypress now properly handles typing JavaScript object prototype methods (like `hasOwnProperty`) into {% url `.type()` type %}. Fixes {% issue 3423 %}.
- We now set the `form` option to `true` if the `Content-Type` header equals `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and `json` is not already set by a user. This fixes a situation where Cypress would try to parse the `body` as a string, resulting in a confusing error message. Fixes {% issue 2923 %}.
- Fixed display of tooltips when selecting elements from the Selector Playground so that they display at the correct coordinates when scrolling. Fixes {% issue 1351 %}.
- The lists of spec files now display at the correct indentation level when they are nested more than 5 directories deep. Fixes {% issue 3652 %}.
- Cypress now properly parses environment variables with empty values. Fixes {% issue 3742 %}.
- Assertions running outside of a test are now properly handled in Cypress instead of throwing internal errors. Fixes {% issue 3926 %}.

**Misc:**

- We now better support capturing environment variables within Azure DevOps. Addresses {% issue 3657 %}.
- The ability to open the context menu to see "Inspect Element" has been reenable in the Electron browser. Addresses {% issue 4002 %}
- We no longer package non-Windows `ffmpeg` builds with Windows builds, resulting in a 35-40% reduction in zipped size and a 36-43% reduction in unzipped size of download. Addresses {% issue 3888 %}.
- When an HTTP request is received by the proxy layer, by default, we send it with a `Connection: keep-alive` header so that the connection will be reused if possible. Addresses {% issue 3857 %}.
- Improved accessibility of Test Runner for screen readers. Addresses {% issue 3850 %}.
- Cypress type definition now allow a `timeout` option in {% url "`cy.hash()`" hash %}. Fixes {% issue 3844 %}.
- Fixed type definition for `match` assertion so that it now only accepts `RegExp` type arguments. Fixes {% issue 2578 %}.
- The {% url "`.trigger()`" trigger %} type definition now expects its `options` to be `ObjectLike`. Addressed in {% PR 3809 %}.
