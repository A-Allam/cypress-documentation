# 3.3.0

*Released 4/1/2019*

**Features:**

- Cypress now automatically reads from your system's `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY` environment variables and proxies traffic accordingly through Cypress based on these values. This includes network traffic within your application under test, when downloading Cypress, and when accessing 'Runs' within the Test Runner. Please read our new {% url "Proxy Configuration" proxy-configuration %} doc to understand more about proxy configuration in Cypress. Fixes {% issue 672 %}, {% issue 733 %}, {% issue 939 %}, {% issue 1039 %}, {% issue 1459 %}, {% issue 1469 %}, {% issue 1470 %}, {% issue 1541 %}, {% issue 1608 %}, {% issue 2295 %}, {% issue 3855 %}, and {% issue 3857 %}.
- Your project's current proxy settings now display in the {% url "Settings of the Test Runner" proxy-configuration#View-proxy-settings-in-Cypress %}. Addresses {% issue 3856 %}.
- The links to Cypress documentation are now clickable directly within the error messages displayed in the Command Log. Addresses {% issue 3456 %}.
